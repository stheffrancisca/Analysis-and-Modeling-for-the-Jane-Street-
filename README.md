# Analysis-and-Modeling-for-the-Jane-Street-
Competition on Kaggle

Understanding the Data

### I started by analyzing the dataset to understand its structure, the number of variables, and the challenges posed by the anonymized features.
I carefully reviewed the description of the weighted R² metric to optimize my model with a focus on the evaluation metric.
Exploration and Preparation

During exploratory data analysis, I visualized variable distributions and identified significant outliers. I developed strategies to address these anomalies.
I noticed non-stationary patterns in the time series data, requiring adjustments to my models to handle dynamic changes.
Modeling

I began with baseline models, such as linear regression and decision trees, to establish a reference point.
I then progressed to more advanced models, like LightGBM, which proved effective for handling large datasets and time series properties.
I experimented with neural networks to capture complex nonlinear patterns and compared their performance against boosting models.
Submission

After fine-tuning the final model, I tested the notebook locally to ensure it ran within the competition’s time limits.
I submitted the model using the API provided on Kaggle, adhering to all competition requirements.
Results

Following the submission, I analyzed the metrics and identified areas for improvement, such as:
Fine-tuning hyperparameters further.
Experimenting with Transformer-based models to better capture temporal dynamics.

# Implementation Example:

# Below is a simplified code snippet demonstrating the initial steps of loading data, preprocessing, and setting up a LightGBM model within a Kaggle notebook environment:


# Import necessary libraries
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import lightgbm as lgb
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import r2_score

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/jane-street-market-prediction/train.csv')

# Inspect the first few rows
print(data.head())

# Data Preprocessing
# Fill missing values
data.fillna(-999, inplace=True)

# Feature Engineering (example: creating a simple feature)
data['feature_sum'] = data.filter(like='feature').sum(axis=1)

# Define features and target
features = [col for col in data.columns if 'feature' in col]
target = 'resp'

# Split the data into training and validation sets
X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(data[features], data[target], test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initialize and train the LightGBM model
model = lgb.LGBMRegressor(n_estimators=1000, learning_rate=0.01)
model.fit(X_train, y_train, eval_set=[(X_val, y_val)], early_stopping_rounds=100, verbose=50)

# Evaluate the model
y_pred = model.predict(X_val)
score = r2_score(y_val, y_pred)
print(f'Validation R² Score: {score}')
